# Orchestration Tools Comparison

This repository compares the features, configurations, and implementations of four popular orchestration tools—**Argo Workflows**, **Apache Airflow**, **Tekton**, and **Kestra**—by implementing a common pipeline.

### Pipeline to Implement

The pipeline being implemented is defined as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->D;
    B-->D;
    C-->E;
    C-->F;
    D-->E;
    D-->G;
    F-->G;
```

Each tool has its own folder in the repository, containing:
1. **An example implementation** of the pipeline.
2. **A detailed README** explaining how to install, configure, and run the tool for this use case.
